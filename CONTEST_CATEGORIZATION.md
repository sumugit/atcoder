# AtCoder Problem Domains

This repository contains source code from past AtCoder contests. The following table groups some of the solutions by their primary problem domain.

| Problem Domain | Example File Paths |
|---------------|-------------------|
| **Graph Algorithms** | `abc/abc309/d.py` – BFS on two graphs to compute distances; `abc/abc320/d.py` – DFS to determine coordinates in a graph; `abc/abc269/d.py` – uses Union-Find to connect points. |
| **Dynamic Programming** | `abc/abc261/d.py` – DP table for coin toss game; `tessoku/chapter4/A20.py` – LCS dynamic programming example. |
| **Search / Backtracking** | `abc/abc310/d.py` – DFS/backtracking to place players into teams considering conflicts. |
| **Bit Operations / Strings** | `abc/abc301/d.py` – manipulates binary string with bit operations; `arc/arc151/a.py` – operates on binary strings to minimize difference. |
| **Math / Number Theory** | `arc/arc148/a.py` – uses GCD over array differences to decide output. |
| **Data Structures** | `abc/abc355/d.py` – interval counting via coordinate compression; `tessoku/chapter6/A44.py` – array updates with lazy reversal flag. |
| **Breadth-First Search (Grid)** | `abc/abc348/d.py` – BFS on a grid with remaining energy for movement. |
| **Binary Search** | `tessoku/chapter3/A11.py` – uses `bisect` to find element position. |

These categories are not exhaustive but provide a high-level organization of typical topics found in the solutions.
